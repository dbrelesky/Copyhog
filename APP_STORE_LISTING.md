## Name

## Subtitle
Your clipboard's got a memory now.

## Description

Ever copy something brilliant, then copy something else and watch it vanish into the void? Yeah, that's the worst.

**Meet Copyhog** — a tiny pig that lives in your menu bar and hoards everything you copy. Text, images, screenshots — nothing escapes the Hog.

**Clipboard history that actually works.**
Every Cmd+C you've ever regretted losing is now sitting in a beautiful card grid, one click away. Browse, search, and grab anything from your last 500 copies. Your clipboard finally has a brain.

**Screenshots on autopilot.**
Copyhog watches for new screenshots the moment they hit your desktop, scoops them up, organizes them in a tidy folder, and drops them onto your clipboard — ready to paste. No more hunting through your Desktop for that screenshot you took 4 seconds ago.

**Multi-copy like a pro.**
Need to grab a bunch of items at once? Cmd-click to select multiple clips, hit copy, and paste them all — with full rich text and images — into Notes, Mail, Pages, or wherever you need them.

**Privacy-first. No cloud. No creepy stuff.**
Copyhog runs 100% locally on your Mac. Nothing leaves your machine. Passwords from 1Password, Keychain, and other sensitive apps are automatically detected and shielded. You can mark any app as shielded too.

**The highlights:**
- Instant access from any app with ⌃⌘C
- Search across your entire clipboard history
- Full keyboard navigation — never touch your mouse
- Drag and drop clips into any app
- Plain Paste (⇧⌘V) strips formatting instantly
- Auto-Paste mode drops content right where your cursor is
- Launch at login — set it and forget it
- Light, Dark, or System appearance
- Configurable history size (20–500 items)

Copyhog is fast, lightweight, and lives quietly in your menu bar until you need it. It doesn't phone home, it doesn't sync to the cloud, and it definitely doesn't judge what you copy.

Give your clipboard a memory. Let the Hog do the hoarding.
