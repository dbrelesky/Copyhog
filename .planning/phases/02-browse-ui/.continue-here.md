<current_state>
Phase 2 (Browse UI) execution is complete — plan 02-01 fully executed and committed. Automated verification passed (4/4 must-haves, 4/4 requirements). Currently in the execute-phase workflow between the verifier return and the phase-close step. The verifier returned `human_needed` status — 4 live-app tests were presented to the user but user invoked /gsd:pause-work before responding.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Plan 02-01 Task 1: Refactor PopoverContent into split-view layout — DONE (commit 2d7a7f2)
  - Created PreviewPane.swift (200pt top, full-size image aspect-fit or scrollable text)
  - Created ItemRow.swift (64x64 thumbnails, 2-line snippets, relative timestamps, onHover)
  - Refactored PopoverContent.swift (@State hoveredItemID, ContentUnavailableView empty state)
  - Xcode project.pbxproj updated with new files
- Plan 02-01 Task 2: Human verification checkpoint — DONE (user approved in-session)
- 02-01-SUMMARY.md created (commit 45e58b8)
- STATE.md updated to Phase 2 complete, 40% progress
- ROADMAP.md updated with plan progress (02-01 marked [x])
- gsd-verifier ran — 02-VERIFICATION.md created, status: human_needed
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Human verification of 4 live-app behaviors (empty state, item list, hover preview, default preview) — user already approved the checkpoint during execution so this is likely a formality
- Phase close: run `node gsd-tools.cjs phase complete "2"` to mark phase done in ROADMAP.md, STATE.md, REQUIREMENTS.md
- Commit phase completion docs
- Route to next step (Phase 3 planning or execution)
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Used @State hoveredItemID with "last writer wins" onHover pattern — handles known macOS .onHover exit-callback bug
- PreviewPane height fixed at 200pt of 480pt total — leaves ~280pt for scrollable item list
- ContentUnavailableView (macOS 14+ native) for empty state instead of custom VStack
- Default preview shows most recent item (store.items.first) when nothing is hovered
- Thumbnails in rows use thumbnailPath (64x64), only PreviewPane loads full-size via filePath
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — all code work is done. Just needs phase-close workflow steps.

<context>
The execute-phase workflow was interrupted mid-flight. The verifier returned human_needed but the user paused before responding to the verification prompt. The user already approved the checkpoint during plan execution (they saw the running app), so the 4 human verification items are likely fine. On resume, the simplest path is: get user approval on verification → run phase complete → route to Phase 3.
</context>

<next_action>
Resume the execute-phase workflow:
1. Present the 4 human verification items from 02-VERIFICATION.md to the user
2. On approval: run `node gsd-tools.cjs phase complete "2"` and commit
3. Present Phase 2 complete banner and route to Phase 3
