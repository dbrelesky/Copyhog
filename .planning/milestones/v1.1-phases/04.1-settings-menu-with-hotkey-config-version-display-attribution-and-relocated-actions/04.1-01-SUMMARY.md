# Phase 04.1 Plan 01: Settings Menu Summary

**SwiftUI gear icon dropdown menu housing version display, attribution, Hog Wipe with alert confirmation, and Quit -- decluttering the main popover toolbar**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 2 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-21T22:13:45Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-21T22:16:04Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 3

## Accomplishments
- Created SettingsMenu.swift with gear icon dropdown containing version, attribution, Hog Wipe, and Quit
- Replaced inline Hog Wipe toolbar buttons with proper .alert confirmation dialog
- Removed Quit Copyhog button from bottom of popover
- Toolbar decluttered to only multi-select toggle + gear menu

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create SettingsMenu view** - `4792af1` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Integrate SettingsMenu and remove relocated actions** - `7f0e906` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `Copyhog/Copyhog/Views/SettingsMenu.swift` - New settings menu with gear icon, version, attribution, Hog Wipe, Quit
- `Copyhog/Copyhog/Views/PopoverContent.swift` - Removed inline Hog Wipe/Quit, added SettingsMenu and .alert
- `Copyhog/Copyhog.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` - Added SettingsMenu.swift to Xcode project

## Decisions Made
- Used SwiftUI Menu with Binding<Bool> to communicate Hog Wipe intent from SettingsMenu to PopoverContent (which owns the alert state)
- Replaced inline Cancel/Wipe toolbar buttons with .alert confirmation dialog for cleaner UX

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Settings menu complete with version display, attribution, Hog Wipe, and Quit
