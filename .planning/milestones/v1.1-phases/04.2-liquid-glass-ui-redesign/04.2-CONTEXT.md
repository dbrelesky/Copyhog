# Phase 04.2: Liquid Glass UI Redesign - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Redesign the popover's visual appearance to use Apple's "liquid glass" aesthetic — translucent materials, vibrancy effects, refined spacing, and interaction polish across all existing views (PopoverContent, PreviewPane, ItemRow, SettingsMenu). No new features or capabilities — purely visual and interaction refinement of existing UI.

## Implementation Decisions

### Material & translucency
- Full popover background gets glass treatment — entire popover is translucent
- Medium translucency level — like macOS sidebar materials (sense what's behind, can't read it)
- Preview pane is a distinct elevated glass layer — slightly different material or shadow separating it from the list below
- No hard divider lines between sections — glass layers and material differences create visual separation

### Color & accent palette
- Use system accent color for interactive elements (buttons, selection highlights, checkboxes) — respect user's macOS preference
- Warm and friendly color feel — softer than pure Apple gray, fits the hedgehog brand personality
- Slightly warmer tones in the glass tint or background colors

### Layout & spacing
- Bump popover size to ~400x520px to give the glass aesthetic more breathing room
- Toolbar merges into the glass seamlessly — remove hard dividers, buttons float in the glass with no visible bar
- Keep 64x64 rounded rect thumbnails — current size and shape work, just restyle the background/treatment

### Interaction polish
- Hover effect: soft glow or luminance shift behind hovered row (not a flat gray overlay)
- Popover open: fast, subtle animation (speed is priority — don't compromise responsiveness for flair)
- Copy confirmation: brief checkmark overlay appears on the row after single-click copy
- Empty state: custom hedgehog-themed illustration or icon that fits the warm glass aesthetic

### Claude's Discretion
- Row material treatment — whether rows float directly on background or get subtle secondary glass cards
- Text contrast approach — vibrant labels vs high-contrast fixed (whatever works best for medium-translucency glass)
- Icon weight/style — pick SF Symbol weight that fits the glass aesthetic
- Corner radii — pick radii that match the liquid glass look across popover and internal elements
- Animation specifics — exact timing, easing, scale amount for the fast popover entrance

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- Warm and friendly feel — "like a hedgehog's cozy den, not a sterile Apple settings panel"
- Preview pane should feel elevated/raised above the list — visual depth through material difference
- Toolbar should disappear into the glass — no visible bar, just floating action buttons
- Copy confirmation checkmark should be quick and non-blocking — don't delay the user's workflow
- Popover animation must be fast — user wants to feel the app is snappy, animation is seasoning not the main course
