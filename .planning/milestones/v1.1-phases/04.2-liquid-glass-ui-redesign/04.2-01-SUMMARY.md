# Phase 04.2 Plan 01: Liquid Glass Shell Summary

**Translucent glass popover (400x520) with ultraThinMaterial background, elevated regularMaterial preview pane, floating toolbar, and warm orange tint**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 1 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-21T23:51:11Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-21T23:52:19Z
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments
- Popover resized to 400x520 with translucent ultraThinMaterial glass background
- All hard Divider() lines removed — material differences and spacing create separation
- Preview pane elevated as glass card with regularMaterial, shadow, and rounded corners
- Toolbar buttons float freely with increased padding and no visible bar
- Hog Wipe confirmation styled as floating glass card
- Warm orange tint (3% opacity) applied for cozy hedgehog den feel
- System accent color applied to all interactive elements

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Glass popover shell and floating toolbar** - `5ad01a9` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Elevated glass preview pane** - `be5b29e` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `Copyhog/Copyhog/CopyhogApp.swift` - Popover frame resized to 400x520
- `Copyhog/Copyhog/Views/PopoverContent.swift` - Glass background, removed dividers, floating toolbar, warm tint, accent color
- `Copyhog/Copyhog/Views/PreviewPane.swift` - regularMaterial background, shadow, rounded corners, image inner rounding
- `Copyhog/Copyhog/Views/SettingsMenu.swift` - Gear icon fontWeight(.medium) for glass readability

## Decisions Made
- Used ultraThinMaterial for popover background and regularMaterial for preview pane to create visual hierarchy through material density difference
- Applied 3% orange opacity warm tint — barely perceptible shift from sterile Apple gray to cozy feel
- Styled Hog Wipe confirmation bar as a floating glass card with regularMaterial and cornerRadius 10

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered
None.

## User Setup Required
None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness
- Glass shell and preview pane complete, ready for Plan 02 (item row polish, hover effects, animations)
- Material hierarchy established: ultraThinMaterial (background) < regularMaterial (cards)
