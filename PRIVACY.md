# Privacy Policy

**Copyhog** — Last updated: February 22, 2026

## The short version

Copyhog doesn't collect, store, or transmit any of your data to anyone. Everything stays on your Mac. That's it. That's the policy.

## Data Collection

Copyhog collects **nothing**. Zero. Zilch. The Hog is hungry, but only for your clipboard — and it keeps that entirely to itself.

- No analytics
- No telemetry
- No crash reporting
- No account creation
- No sign-in required
- No third-party SDKs
- No advertising frameworks

## Data Storage

All clipboard history (text and images) is stored **locally on your Mac** in your user Application Support directory. This data never leaves your machine and is only accessible to you.

- Clipboard items: `~/Library/Application Support/Copyhog/`
- Organized screenshots: `~/Documents/Screenies/`

## Network Access

Copyhog makes **zero network requests**. It does not connect to the internet for any reason. There are no servers, no APIs, no cloud sync, and no remote endpoints.

## Sensitive Content

Copyhog automatically detects and shields clipboard content from password managers (1Password, Keychain Access, Dashlane) and other sensitive sources. Shielded items are redacted in the UI and can be manually hidden or revealed by you at any time.

## Your Data, Your Control

- You can delete individual items from your clipboard history at any time
- You can wipe your entire history using "Hog Wipe" in Settings
- Uninstalling Copyhog removes the app — to fully clean up stored data, delete the folders listed above

## Children's Privacy

Copyhog does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy ever changes, updates will be posted here. But honestly, "we collect nothing" is a pretty hard policy to change.
